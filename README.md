# A 1-Dimensional Ice-Pelagic-Benthic transport model, (IPBM)
## About
Coupled simulation of ice, water column, and sediment biogeochemistry.

## Supported compilers:
* recent gfortran compiler (part of GCC)
* Intel Fortran Compiler version 12.1 or higher

## How to use
At first you must have compliant compiler, [Git], [CMake], and [NetCDF] Fortran library compiled with the same Fortran compiler as used for compiling IPBM. For the VisualStudio solution under Windows pre-compiled NetCDF libraries are provided.

Then:

## Linux(bash shell):
1. Download all required programs into the one folder:

  download IPBM

  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/IPBM.git`
   
  download [FABM] and switch to dev-sham branch

  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/FABM.git --branch dev-sham`
  
  download biogeochemistry model and switch to dev-sham branch
  
  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/brom_niva_module.git --branch dev-sham`

  and download ecosystem model

  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/ERSEM.git`

2. Add FABMDIR and NetCDF_ROOT environment variables

  For example you can add to `~/.bashrc` current lines:

  ```
  export FABMDIR='/path/to/FABM'
  export NetCDF_ROOT='/path/to/NetCDF/bin'
  ```
  
  Don't forget reload .bashrc `$ source ~/.bashrc`

3. Make a build 

  Enter IPBM folder and execute `$ bash build_release.sh`

4. Compile the code

  From build folder execute `$ make`

5. Run IPBM

  From build folder execute `$ ./IPBM`

## Windows 10, 8:

1. Download all required programs 

  Right-click in Windows Explorer within the directory where you want to place the IPBM directory, and choose "Git Bash Here", or use PowerShell program. In the terminal that appears to download IPBM type:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/IPBM.git`
   
  then download [FABM] and switch to dev-sham branch

  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/FABM.git --branch dev-sham`
  
  download biogeochemistry model and switch to dev-sham branch
  
  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/brom_niva_module.git --branch dev-sham`

  and download ecosystem model

  `$ git clone https://github.com/limash/ERSEM.git`

  if using other software, use these URLs.
  
2. Add IPBMDIR environment variable (only if you are going to use pre-compiled NetCDF libraries)

  * In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
  * Click the **Advanced system settings** link
  * Click **Environment Variables**. In the section **System Variables** click **New**
  * In the **New System Variable** specify the name **IPBMDIR** and the value **path:\to\IPBM**

3. Make a build

  * Start "CMake"
  * Browse the **Where is the source code** to the **path:\to\IPBM\src**
  * Browse the **Where to build the binaries** - e.g. **path:\to\IPBM\build**
  * Click the **Configure** button. Select a build system generator, if you use Intel Visual Fortran with Visual Studio integration and want to use NetCDF libraries that come with IPBM please select a 32-bit generator.
  * Now all configuration variables for the build system are listed and you can change them according to your preferences. You need set FABM_BASE variable to the directory where you have downloaded [FABM]. Then click the **Configure** button again. Specify FABM_ERSEM_BASE as well. Then click the **Configure** button again. Select **Advanced** option and specify -DFABM_NIVA_BASE to `path/to/brom_niva_module` also.
  * Click the **Configure** button until no new (red-coloured) configuration variables appear, then press **Generate** button.

4. Compile the code

  After generating the build system, you should build the software. You can do either by opening Visual Studio and choosing **Build All** (after opening **path:\to\IPBM\build\IPBM.sln**, right click on IPBM in **Solution Explorer** and select **Set as StartUp Project**) or typing **make** if using a build system based on makefiles.

5. Run IPBM

  Now you have **IPBM.exe** file in your `path:\to\IPBM\build\Debug(Release)` directory. It needs `fabm.yaml` and `KaraSea.nc` files as input data. You can find it in `..\IPBM\data` folder. In case of running IPBM under Visual Studio remember to specify the working directory (`..\IPBM\data`).
